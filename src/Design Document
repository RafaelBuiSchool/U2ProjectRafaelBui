EQUATION RUNNER CLASS:
Step 1: Import scanner in order to accept user inputs
Step 2: Ask user for first coordinate
Step 3: Ask user for second coordinate
Step 4: Call the methods in linearEquation class
Step 5: Print out their first coordinate
Step 6: Print out their second coordinate
Step 7: Print out the slope of the line
Step 8: Print out y intercept
Step 9: Print out slope intercept form
Step 10: Print out the distance between the points
Step 11: Prompt user to enter an x value
Step 12: Call the method to determine corresponding y value
Step 13: Print the coordinate point


LinearEquation Class{

Instance Variables:
    private double slope; Represents the slope of the coordinates

    private double yIntercept; Represents the y intercept

    private double x1; Represents the parsedouble value of converting the x value of the first coordinate, into a double

    private double y1; Represents the parsedouble value of converting the y value of the first coordinate, into a double

    private double x2; Represents the parsedouble value of converting the x value of the second coordinate, into a double

    private double y2; Represents the parsedouble value of converting the y value of the second coordinate, into a double

    private String slopeInterceptForm; Represents the slopeInterceptForm given the coordinates

    private double distance; Represents the distance between coordinates

     private double yValue; Represents the y value for the n x value
Constructors:
    Constructor LinearEquation(coordinate1,coordinate2){
            Assigns the values to the instance variables
Methods:
    coordinateConversion(String coordinate1,String coordinate2){
    Converts the coordinates into x1, x2, y1, y2

    }
    slopeFinder(x1,y1,x2,y2){
        Finds the slope of the two coordinate points

    distanceFinder(x1,y1,x2,y2){
        Finds the distance between the two coordinate points

     yInterceptFinder(x1,y1){
       b = slope(x1) + y1
       returns the value of b or the y-intercept once calculated

     slopeInterceptFormCalculator(x,y){
        return y = slope(x) + b;

     yValueCalculator(x){
        calculates the y value based on the x value, slope and y intercept and then returns that value;

     toString()
        returns the formatted version of the slope, distance, y intercept, slope intercept form given the coordinates
